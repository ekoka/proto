roles
-----
- when user specifies the active_role through qs param, it should be popped out of the params dict to not affect the cache key
- when the active_role specified by user isn't part of its roles, the system should silently ignore it (still pop it out of the params dict).  
- only resources that need to know which role the user is assuming will need to use the `user.active_role` attribute.
- the role should only be part of cache key when the resource changes depending on it.

cache
-----
- to cache response we need `cache_response(path, params, response, role=None)` and `load_response(path, params, role=None)`
- to cache other resources we need `cache_resource(key, value)` and `load_resource`
- need a dependency mapper for resources
- owner specific resources should not be cached
